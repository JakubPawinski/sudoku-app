# Sudoku Game

## Project Overview

This project is a fully-featured **Sudoku game** developed using **Pygame**. Sudoku is a classic logic-based number puzzle where players fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring no repetition in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. The game offers a polished user experience with multiple difficulty levels, dynamic themes, and advanced features like score tracking and game state persistence.

The game is designed for single-player use and provides an engaging and intuitive interface for players of all skill levels.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard for a tailored challenge.
- **Dynamic Themes**: Switch between light and dark themes for a personalized visual experience.
- **Pencil Mode**: Take notes directly on the board to assist with solving puzzles.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks and displays scores based on performance, including high scores for each difficulty level.
- **Game Persistence**: Save and resume your last game seamlessly.
- **API Integration**: Sudoku boards are dynamically fetched from an external API for variety and replayability.
- **Error Feedback**: Lose health points for incorrect moves, adding a layer of challenge.

## Game Rules:

1.  The standard Sudoku board consists of a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 blocks. Each block is further divided into 3x3 fields.
2.  The player fills the board with numbers from 1 to 9. Each number can only appear once in each row, column, and 3x3 block.
3.  The game starts with a partially filled grid, where some fields already have numbers.
4.  Each field on the board can only contain one digit. The player's task is to fill the entire board.
